# Malaria Parasite Detection
Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills. While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries. Malaria is a contagious and deadly disease, which has been declared as an endemic in a lot of countries by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is caused by a virus known as Plasmodium parasite, which lives in the mosquito’s body and is injected into affected person’s blood once the mosquito bites the person.
