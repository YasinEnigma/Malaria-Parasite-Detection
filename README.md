Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills. While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries. Malaria is a contagious and deadly disease, which has been declared as an endemic in a lot of countries by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is caused by a virus known as Plasmodium parasite, which lives in the mosquito’s body and is injected into affected person’s blood once the mosquito bites the person.

You can find dataset for this project in [here](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/pubs/MalariaDatasets.html). This dataset is contains Parasitized and Uninfected image class cells.
